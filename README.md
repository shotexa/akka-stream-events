# Bet History

## Starting the project

To run the project: `$ cd bet-history && ./run.sh` to run it inside docker container

_this will take some time, until it downloads java 11 image, downloads `coursier`, downloads `sbt`, downloads all project dependencies and then assembles everything in jar file._

Alternatively, if you have sbt installed, just `$ sbt run`, this will be way faster then with docker.
